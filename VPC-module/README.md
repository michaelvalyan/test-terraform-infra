### README for VPC Module Management

This README outlines the steps and considerations for using the provided Terraform script to deploy and manage a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS. This script facilitates the creation of a VPC along with public and private subnets, allowing for a structured and secure network environment for your resources.

#### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI: Ensure the AWS CLI is installed and configured with the necessary credentials.
- Terraform: This module requires Terraform for infrastructure as code management.

#### Overview

The Terraform script for the VPC module includes:

- Outputs for the VPC ID, public subnet IDs, and private subnet IDs.
- Variables for customization, including a greeting phrase and project name.

#### How to Use the Terraform Script

1. **Initialization:**
   Run `terraform init` to prepare your Terraform environment, downloading necessary providers.

2. **Configuration:**
   Customize the variables in the script as needed for your project, such as the project name or any specific network configurations.

3. **Plan and Apply:**
   Execute `terraform plan` to review the proposed changes, followed by `terraform apply` to create the VPC along with its subnets.

#### Outputs

- `vpc_id`: The ID of the VPC created.
- `public_subnet_ids`: A list of IDs for the public subnets created within the VPC.
- `private_subnet_ids`: A list of IDs for the private subnets created within the VPC.

#### Customization

The script includes variables that allow for customization of the deployment:
- `greeting`: A greeting phrase, demonstrating how to pass custom values into the Terraform script.
- `project_name`: The name of the project, used to tag resources for easier management and billing.

#### Conclusion

This Terraform script simplifies the process of creating a structured VPC environment in AWS, with clear outputs for network management and customization options for various project needs.
